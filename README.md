# The Sound of CPU Usage
What does CPU usage sound like? Like this, apparently. <br>
To be honest, it doesn't sound that bad.

## What is this

This is a Python script that uses your current CPU usage to generate a MIDI file.

## How to use

You will need `midiutil` and `psutil`, which can be installed using 
`pip install MIDIUtil` and `pip install psutil` respectively.

Then just run the script with `python3 the-sound-of-cpu-usage.py`.

## Why did you do this
Yes.
